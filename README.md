Introduction
<br>
<br>
The project aims at detecting COVID-19 using Symptoms. 
I decided to use Machine Learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to detect the presence of Covid 19 using symtpoms.
For the image classification problem which includes detecting COVID-19 using Spectrograms, I used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs).

METHODOLOGY
<br>
<br>
Since the data is skewed, I decided to use SMOTE to ensure that the minority class is not suffering due to less data points. 
However, we also performed predictive analysis without using SMOTE to compare the two models.
